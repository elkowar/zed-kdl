# Zed KDL Support

Simple extension that provides syntax highlighting and language support
for the KDL language, used for configuration in projects such as the [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) compositor.

Specifically has functionality to provide syntax highlighting for embedded GLSL code blocks, when a field is called `custom-shader`.

Based on the [tree-sitter-kdl](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-kdl) grammar and queries.
